# To Do Web App Created And Hosted On AWS

This application is a ToDo web application that uses Angular for the frontend, Python for the backend, and AWS as the cloud platform.

I am about to take my CCP certification so I am building this app to test my self and see if I have understood all the AWS concepts really well.
